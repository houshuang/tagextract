	looking at the theory as a learning theory, no empiry
	Learning @learning
		learning happens when learner connects to and feeds information into learning community
		learning community is a node, always part of larger network
		nodes varying size and strength (concentration of info and number of people)
		learning transpires through use of cognitive and affective domains
		learning process is cyclical
		peripheries of knowledge fields porous, learners may traverse networks through multiple knowledge domains
		act of recognizing patterns shaped by complex networks
			internal, as neural networks
			external, as networks in which we adapt to the world around us (Siemens 2006b)

	Learner skills necessary @challenge_for_learning
		seek out current info
		filter secondary/extraneous info
		see connections between fields, ideas, concepts

	View of knowledge @knowledge
		information is constantly changing (validity and accuracy change over time)
		knowledge is distributed across info network, stored in variety of digital formats @networks
		learning and knowledge ârest in diversity of opinionsâ (Siemens 2008)
		knowledge is âsubsymbolicâ (Downes 1996)
		a recognition of a pattern in a set of neural events [if we are introspecting] or behavioural events [if we are observing]
		the experience of a mental state that is at best seen as an approximation of what it is that is being said in words or experienced in nature, an approximation that is framed and, indeed, comprehensible only from which the rich set of world views, previous experiences and frames in which it is embedded @pattern-recognition
		denies that knowledge is propositional (different from all other epistemologies)
			other epistemologies are cognitivist - language and logic
			connectivism is connectionist
				not essentially based in linguistic structures
				constraints and properties of linguistic structures are not the constraints and properties of connectivism
		âunderstandingâ is a distribution of connections across a network.
		* to âknow that Pâ is therefore equated with âa certain set of neural connectionsâ that entail being in a certain physical stateâ unique to the experiencer of that state.
		âdeep thinkingâ or âcreating understandingâ are equivalent to the process of making connections, and that there are no mental models per se (i.e., no systematically constructed rule-based representational systems), and what there is (i.e., connectionist networks) is not built, like a model; but instead it is grown, like a plant

Connectivism:
	principles @theory @connectivism
		Learning and knowledge rests in diversity of opinions
		Learning is a process of connecting specialized nodes or information sources
		Learning may reside in non-human appliances
		Capacity to know more is more critical than what is currently known
		Nurturing and maintaining connections is needed to facilitate continual learning
		Ability to see connections between fields, ideas concepts is a core skill
		Currency (accurate, up-to-date knowledge) is the intent of all connectivist learning activities
		Decision-making is itself a learning process Choosing what to learn and the meaning of incoming information is seen through the lens of a shifting reality While there is a right answer now, it may be wrong tomorrow due to alterations in the information climate affecting the decision
